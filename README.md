# nanobook

this is the second project in my budding series of ultra-minimal barebones blockchain projects

it is a 100% on-chain CLOB that will be as small as i could possibly make it to still resemble what a CLOB is supposed to do

a few implementation decisions (128-order limit, FreeBitmap, token_utils) came from metaproph3t and https://github.com/metaDAOproject/YALOB

obviously this will not be intended for production usage and is more just for fun & to learn about CLOB architecture
