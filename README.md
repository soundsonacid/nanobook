this is the second project in my budding series of ultra-minimal barebones blockchain projects

it is a CLOB that will be as small as i could possibly make it to still resemble what a CLOB is supposed to do

obviously this will not be intended for production usage and is more just for fun & to learn about CLOB architecture
